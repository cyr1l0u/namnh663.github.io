# Test Case Design

To design effective test cases, you need to follow a few key steps:

1. **Identify the test objectives.** What do you want to test? What functionality or behavior are you trying to verify?
2. **Analyze the requirements.** What are the functional, non-functional, and integration requirements for the system or feature you are testing?
3. **Design test scenarios.** These are high-level descriptions of the different ways that the system can be used and the different types of inputs and outputs that are possible.
4. **Derive test cases.** Each test case should be a specific instance of a test scenario. It should include the following information:
    * Test case ID
    * Test case name
    * Preconditions (the state of the system before the test case is executed)
    * Test steps
    * Test data
    * Expected result
    * Actual result
    * Status

Sample example: [Template](https://namnh663.github.io/docs/document.html#test-case)

Here are some best practices for designing effective test cases:

* **Focus on user requirements.** Make sure that your test cases cover all of the critical aspects of the application that users will be interacting with.
* **Keep test cases simple and concise.** Each test case should focus on a single test objective. Avoid creating test cases that are too complex or that test multiple things at once.
* **Cover both positive and negative scenarios.** Positive testing verifies that the system works as expected when given valid inputs. Negative testing verifies that the system handles invalid or unexpected inputs gracefully.
* **Use boundary value analysis and equivalence partitioning.** Boundary value analysis tests the system at the edges of its input domain. Equivalence partitioning divides the input domain into equivalence classes, and then tests one test case from each equivalence class.
* **Use a consistent format and structure for test cases.** This will make them easier to read, understand, and maintain.

Once you have designed your test cases, you should review them with other team members to get feedback. This will help to ensure that your test cases are comprehensive and effective.
