# Scrum

Scrum is an agile project management framework that helps teams structure and manage their work through a set of values, principles, and practices. It is an iterative and incremental approach to product development, which means that teams work in short, fixed-length cycles called sprints to deliver working pieces of a product.

**Scrum Values**

The Scrum values are the foundation of the framework and provide guidance for how teams should work together. The three Scrum values are:

* **Commitment:** Everyone on the team is committed to achieving the project goals.
* **Focus:** The team focuses on completing the work in the current sprint.
* **Openness:** The team is open to feedback and willing to change their approach as needed.

**Scrum Principles**

The Scrum principles are the rules that govern how Scrum is implemented. The five Scrum principles are:

* **Self-organization:** The team organizes and manages their own work.
* **Self-management:** The team takes responsibility for their own performance.
* **Collaboration:** The team works together to achieve common goals.
* **Accountability:** Individuals are accountable for their own work.
* **Transparency:** The team's work is visible to everyone.

**Scrum Activities**

* **Product backlog:** A prioritized list of work items that the team needs to complete.
* **Sprints:** Fixed-length cycles of work, typically two weeks long.
* **Daily scrum:** A short daily meeting where the team discusses their progress and plans for the day.
* **Sprint review:** A meeting at the end of each sprint where the team demonstrates the completed work and gathers feedback from stakeholders.
* **Sprint retrospective:** A meeting at the end of each sprint where the team reflects on their performance and identifies areas for improvement.

**Scrum Roles**

* **Product owner:** The person who is responsible for defining the product requirements and ensuring that the product meets the needs of the stakeholders.
* **Scrum master:** The person who is responsible for facilitating the Scrum process and helping the team to remove impediments.
* **Developers:** The people who do the work of developing the product.

**Benefits of Scrum**

* **Increased agility:** Scrum teams are able to quickly adapt to changes in requirements.
* **Improved quality:** Scrum teams produce high-quality products because they are constantly testing and refactoring their work.
* **Enhanced productivity:** Scrum teams are able to deliver more work in less time.
* **Increased team morale:** Scrum teams are more engaged and motivated because they have more autonomy and control over their work.
